Growing up in Brooklyn, NY - I've always been a believer in **making dreams come true**. I believe building software is more than logic and syntax. **It's magic.** 

Just like a great story, **great code turns dreams into reality**, solving problems in ways that feel effortless. Magic makes the impossible seem possible, and code does the same. With code, I've been able to create experiences that **inspire, empower, and make technology more accessible for everyone**.
