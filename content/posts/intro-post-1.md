## Why Syntax? Why Stories? And Why Now?

I have always been interested in software and stories. Code syntax defines structure and logic, but storytelling? That is where connection happens. It becomes the place where code meets purpose which becomes a conversation.

So, let me start by introducing myself. I am Corey. I am a C# developer who loves staying up to date on the latest in developer tooling and updates. I am a DevRel leader who is passionate about helping others bring their ideas to life. Most importantly, I am a parent to two amazing kids who shape how I think, communicate, and solve problems.

With Corey‚Äôs Syntax & Stories, I want to create a space where these parts of my identity combine‚Äîwhere I can share my observations and learning with you.

## What You'll Find Here

Over the course of my career, I discovered the most valuable lessons aren't found in documentation. They come from real-life moments, unexpected challenges, and conversations that push us forward. Below is just a taste of what you can expect to find here.

### Coding & Debugging

I am always either exploring the latest developer trends or making progress on the many projects I start with File --> New. Whether it is building something new just for the fun of it or trying to fix code that mysteriously broke overnight, I‚Äôll be sharing my wins, struggles, learnings, and everything else in between.

### DevRel & Leadership

Growing this chapter of my career as a leader in developer relations has been about navigating influence, mentorship, strategy, and execution. I‚Äôll share some observations and insights on how to be effective in developer relations - whether through bridging gaps, scaling advocacy and engagement, or creating lasting impact in developer communities.

### Parenting & Balance

Juggling a tech career while also raising kids is a never-ending adventure‚Äîequal parts rewarding and chaotic. I spend many days bouncing between my role as a DevRel leader while other days require me to negotiate schedules, and extra-curricular activities. I will be sharing stories, lessons learned, and more dad jokes than necessary.

## Let's Build Together

This blog is not only about me‚Äîit's about us. The developers, the storytellers, the parents, the problem-solvers.

Whether you are exploring a career in tech or trying to grow into leadership, adjusting to navigating career and family, or just here for a fresh perspective, welcome.

Let's explore syntax and stories together.
