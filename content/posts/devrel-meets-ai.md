Ask any developer relations (DevRel) leader what makes a great developer advocate, and you‚Äôll hear some of the usual answers:
- community engagement
- public speaking 
- technical content creation. 

But I believe the best developer advocates are **_developers who advocate_** - they understand the journey because they are living it daily. AI is changing *every* step of a developer‚Äôs journey. What used to be influenced by community engagement, public speaking, and technical content creation is now being quickly replaced with AI powered tools that are evolving faster than anyone ever imagined. 

So what does that mean for developer relations? Well let‚Äôs start from the top ‚Äì what makes for a strong developer advocate?

## What Makes a Strong Developer Advocate?

Too often, DevRel gets mistaken for marketing-lite‚Äîa role centered around flashy events, social media engagement, and top of marketing funnel awareness tactics. But DevRel isn‚Äôt really that. 

My experiences at Microsoft and Twilio helped me realize great developer advocacy puts developer outcomes first. It is about helping developers succeed at the thing they‚Äôve set out to do. Whether that was by educating while inspiring, or removing developer friction, that goal remains the same. By helping them, advocates build an effective relationship which can be useful for those companies they work for.

A strong developer advocate **_writes code, solves problems, and shares lessons_** across multiple platforms and channels.

{{< admonition type=tip title="Tip - Building in Public" open=false >}}
üí° *Example*: As I‚Äôm currently building my Fractions App in C#, and Blazor, I encounter the same learning curves other developers face. By writing about those challenges openly, I create advocacy that‚Äôs ***rooted in real-world experience*** ‚Äî not just polished presentations or social media posts.

## The Business Case for Strategic DevRel

So how does this tie to DevRel strategy? The strongest DevRel strategies align with the developer experience (DX), ensuring advocacy is ***not speaking about developers***, but ***advocating for them*** in ways that genuinely improve their workflow.

Across Microsoft, Twilio, and Okta, I‚Äôve seen different ways in which strategic DevRel transforms products. When developer advocacy is backed by technical expertise, companies win in several ways:
<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
  <li>üìà <strong>Higher product adoption</strong> ‚Äì Developers trust advocates who understand their needs and remove friction</li>
  <li>üéØ <strong>Stronger DX</strong> ‚Äì DevRel guides product teams by actively using the tools developers will rely on and creating a feedback loop that ultimately helps developers.</li>
  <li>üå± <strong>Community that drives innovation</strong> ‚Äì Developer-first engagement leads to real use cases, organic growth, and feedback loops that improve products.</li>
</ul>

The best DevRel strategies create space for all of this to happen. The best DevRel leaders aren‚Äôt just amplifiers of content. They‚Äôre connectors, problem-solvers, and strategic thinkers driving scalable engagement.

## AI in DevRel: Enhancing Developer Experiences with a Human Touch

There‚Äôs no doubt about it. AI is transforming how developers build. In a world where AI is influencing how developers learn, should DevRel leaders and advocates worry? Not at all. See **AI enhances DevRel, but it can‚Äôt replace empathy.**

<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
  <li>ü§ñ AI can automate onboarding and documentation, but *human empathy drives engagement.*</li>
  <li>‚ö° AI-powered code assistants help developers build, but *humans understand context beyond the autocomplete.*</li>
  <li>ü§ù AI enables smarter developer insights, but only *people can build authentic community trust.*</li>
</ul>

My current approach is to ***use AI as a tool, not a replacement***. That means identifying ways it helps amplify developer experiences with our product without sacrificing authenticity. It helps me identify patterns of experiences faster, quickly create and publish content, and connect with more developers.

## Final Thoughts: DevRel Needs More Builders, Less Broadcasters

**_Developer advocacy isn‚Äôt about talking about developers; it‚Äôs about building with developers_**.

Whether through livestreaming, open-source project contributions, or technical content, the best DevRel professionals champion real solutions for real developers.
